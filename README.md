AirBnB clone - The console
In this directory you will find a implementation of a AirBnB clone. In this first step is implemented the Console. Commands for create, update, destroy, show and manage diferent classes and attributes for the items that the app will be offer and for the users.

The console
create your data model
manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
store and persist objects to a file (JSON file) The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored. This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase. The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine
Command interpreter
Our command interpreter looks like a mini shell and allow us manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object

Models Folder: Classes of the project. BaseModel is the parent Class. The other classes (amenity, city, place, review, state, user) inherit from BaseModel and specify others attributes for itselfs.
Tests Folder : Unittests for the project
AUTHORS: Information about the authors
console.py: Executable file for the console
file.json: JSON file with all information of instances
